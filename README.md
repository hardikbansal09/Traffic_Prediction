# Traffic Analysis and Prediction ðŸš¦
About This Project
This project is focused on analyzing traffic patterns and predicting traffic conditions using machine learning. By leveraging historical data, we aim to understand peak traffic times and improve predictions for better traffic management.

Whatâ€™s in the Dataset?
The dataset includes details such as the time and date of the record, the day of the week, and the traffic situation. These features help in identifying patterns and trends that influence traffic conditions.

How We Process the Data
To make the data suitable for machine learning, several preprocessing steps were applied. The time data was converted into an hour format to analyze hourly trends. A weekend indicator was added to distinguish between weekdays and weekends. Traffic conditions were encoded into numerical labels to help the model understand patterns, and unnecessary columns were removed to improve efficiency.

What We Analyzed
Exploratory data analysis was performed to understand traffic trends. A boxplot was used to detect outliers, while visualizations of traffic counts by the hour helped identify peak times. A correlation heatmap was also generated to examine the relationships between different features.

The AI Model
A machine learning model was trained to predict traffic conditions. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the model was evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices.

Results
The model was able to predict traffic situations based on the given features. By comparing actual and predicted values, we assessed its performance and accuracy.
